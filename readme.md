# BS4bookstoscrape

A Python script that scrapes the [bookstoscrape] (https://books.toscrape.com/). website and then creates a .csv with the info obtained

## How it works

This code uses the requests library together with Beautiful soup to connect and then scrap the website

## What you will need to run this code

- Python
- Request library for Python
- Beautiful Soup 4

## How to run

if you are not sure that you have both Beautiful Soup and the Request library installed just do:

pip install beautifulsoup4                                                                                                                                         pip install requests

After that just run it like any other script by using the command: python BS4Scraper.py                                                                    then just wait until its finished and then you should have a file named bookstoscrape.csv in the same folder as the script.
